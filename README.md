# ExcelRegression
I made this script for performing regression on any data in an excel sheet.
When you run the script you are asked to attach the excel file, after that you can specify the parameters of your choice and the result will be printed in the same excel file that you chose in the beginning as a new sheet.
The UI is managed through tkinter.
